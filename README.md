## 💡 Insights & Recommendations

### 📦 Product Improvement
- Several products rated below 3.5 despite deep discounts — may require quality review or de-listing
- Hidden gems (rating ≥ 4.5 but < 500 reviews) should be promoted more aggressively

### 🎯 Marketing Strategy
- Electronics generated the highest potential revenue — ideal for ad targeting
- Home & Kitchen had many products with high reviews and moderate discounts — stable performer

### 👥 Customer Engagement
- 65%+ of products had <1,000 reviews — visibility is a concern
- Use influencer marketing, sponsored ads to boost engagement for quality products with low reach


Electronics dominate in revenue but also show high return rates — possible quality concerns.

52% of products have under 1,000 reviews, indicating a need for better visibility or promotion.

Some low-rated products are still heavily discounted — a flag for poor value perception.

A few standout products drive a large share of reviews and positive sentiment — ideal for spotlighting in marketing.


## 📈 Insights & Recommendations

### ✅ Product Improvement
- Target low-rated products (<3.5) for quality upgrade.
- Investigate products with high returns or discounts for cost-justification.

### 📢 Marketing Strategy
- Focus ad spend on top revenue-generating categories.
- Leverage high influence products (high rating × reviews) in promotions.

### 👥 Customer Engagement
- Improve visibility for products with <1,000 reviews via campaigns.
- Rating distribution suggests overall customer satisfaction is **X% positive** (optional if analyzed).
